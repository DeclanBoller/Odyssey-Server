# Project 3 - Odyssey Server

The Odyssey site was produced by myself as part of WDI-30 in Sydney, Australia. It is a solo project that is helping us prepare for our future development roles. This is also a passion project of mine that will continue to be updated as my skills progress.

## Objectives of Project 3
- Have a backend for the project which is in Ruby on Rails
- Have a front end that can be in React, although does not have to be.
- This app has three models in Rails: Users, Trips and Stops
- I have used the following Gems: 'rack-cors', 'pry-rails', 'bcrypt' and 'geocoder'.
- Heroku: This app has been uploaded to Heroku on the backend and that is where I pull the JSON data from.
